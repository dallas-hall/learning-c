# Learning C
Learning C with a variety of sources.

* CPT220 at university, which includes the following textbooks
  * The famous ANSI C Programming Langauge book.
  * C How To Program 6th Edition

## TODO

Eventually I will be doing:

* Modern C to use modern practices as the above sources are quite old and use deprecated concepts.
* C How To Program 8th Edition
